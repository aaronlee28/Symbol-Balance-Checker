# Symbol-Balance-Checker

The goal of this project is to implement a symbol balance checker function for the Pascal programming language. Pascal allows for the following pairs; {}, (), [], begin end. All programs will begin with the word “begin” and end with the word “end”. The function receives an ifstream object which is already open and will return true if all the symbol matches, and return false if they do not. 

This project highlights the use of a stack.
